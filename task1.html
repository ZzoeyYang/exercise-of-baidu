			<p>Herr Dr. Peter Kurz, mayor of Mannheim, a city in southern Germany revealed 		in Beijing on Tuesday that he is considering connecting the city with its 		Chinese partner city, Qingdao in East China's Shandong province via 			express railway lines to facilitate bilateral commercial activities, 		responding to China's Belt and Road Initiatives.

				Kurz expressed this hope at the city promotion conference held by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and explained that he came up with this idea during his delegation's negotiations with multiple Chinese companies on this visit to China and realized that there are many opportunities in the country.<a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/"></a>

				The mayor told media attending the conference that this is not to say he wants to build a new railway line, but to connect current ones to make an express line. He admitted that he is not sure what needs to be done to make this plan come true but will find out later when he is back in Germany.
